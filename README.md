# Surrodash by Just: a Capstone Project (JCP)

## Project Background

This project was sponsored by [Just--Evotec Biologics](https://www.justbiotherapeutics.com/), a company focused on designing technologies to accelerate the development of biotherapeutics while reducing the manufacturing cost. Just's strengths are in molecular design, process and product design, and manufacturing plant design. 

This project exists at the interface of molecular and process design; the best way to build an affordable manufacturing process is to start with molecules and known operating conditions that produce high protein yields and high purity. 

### So, how do we find the combination of molecular interaction parameters and operating conditions that give the highest yield and purity? 

Companies have used mechanistic models (built on scientific principles and run through computer simulations) in the past to iterate through a list of molecular interaction parameters/operating conditions to predict yield and purity. However, this process requires a lot of time and computing power. What if machine learning could take this already generated data and accurately predict yield and purity based on the same input parameters in a fraction of the time?

Surrodash by JCP seeks to use the provided mechanistic model to produce datasets that can instead train models to predict yield and purity using less time and computational power. The trained predictive models can then be used to pinpoint the molecular interaction parameters and operating conditions that produce the highest yield and purity, allowing Just to focus on the best initial candidates when it comes to molecular and process design.

## Project Use Cases and Components

##### Use Case 1

Module: Mechanistic Model by Just

Function: Generate testing and training datasets.

MM (provided by our sponsor Just) was modified to include the most accurate parameters taken from literature to produce datasets with molecular species interaction parameters and their yield and purity. Data was generated by sampling parameters from a random uniform distribution to give the widest range of possible outputs.

##### Use Case 2

Module: Surrogate Model by JCP

Function: Predict yield and purity for a given set of molecular species interaction parameters faster than the MM.

This python package cleans the input data produced by the MM and trains 4 models (deterministic linear regression, probabilistic linear regression, deterministic NN, and probabilistic NN) to predict yield and purity for a set of given molecular species interaction parameters.

##### Use Case 3

Module: Dash App by JCP

Function: Visualize input datasets, load/train/test/save models, visualize model accuracy, and produce training curves.

This dash app provides visualization of data produced by the MM to show general trends between the data. The app also allows the user to train, test, load, and save models and visualize the model accuracy (what is the MSE? how close are my predicted yield/purity to the actual yield/purity?), as well as validating the training process by showing training curves (should I change the number of epochs? what about the learning rate? how can I improve my model?).

### Project Analysis

#### Best Practices for the Mechanistic Model

#### Model Characterization
Details about the analysis we've performed. Where does the model struggle the most?

### Future Goals and Next Steps

1. Improvements to the mechanistic model?
2. Improvements to the surrogate models?
3. Improvements to the dash platform?

-would've been cool to map protein sequence/structure to yield and purity
