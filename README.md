### Objective: Create and characterize a model to predict yield and purity from isotherm parameters and operating conditions.

Use Case 1: Generate testing and training datasets with different sampling strategies using Just's mechanistic modeling simulation code.

Use Case 2: Pass datasets to surrogate model to predict yield and purity.

Use Case 3: Characterize model error based on isotherm used and number/type of impurity.
