# Surrodash by Just: a Capstone Project (JCP)

### Objective: Create and characterize a model to predict yield and purity using datasets generated from Just's provided mechanistic model.

Use Case 1
	Module: Mechanistic Model by Just
	Function: Generate testing and training datasets.
MM (provided by our sponsor Just) was modified to include the most accurate parameters taken from literature to produce datasets with molecular species interaction parameters and their yield and purity. Data was generated by sampling parameters from a random uniform distribution to give the widest range of possible outputs.

Use Case 2
	Module: Surrogate Model by JCP
	Function: Predict yield and purity for a given set of molecular species interaction parameters faster than the MM.
This python package takes the input data produced by the MM and trains 4 models (deterministic linear regression, probabilistic linear regression, deterministic NN, and probabilistic NN) to predict yield and purity for a set of given molecular species interaction parameters.

Use Case 3
	Module: Dash App by JCP
	Function: Visualize input datasets, load/test/train models, visualize model accuracy, and produce training curves to validate training process.
This dash app provides visualization of data produced by the MM to show general trends between the data. The app also allows the used to train, test, load, and save models and then be able to visualize the model accuracy (what is the MSE? how close are my predicted yield/purity to the actual yield/purity?), and validate the training process by showing training curves (should I change the number of epochs? what about the learning rate?).

### Setup and Operating Instructions
