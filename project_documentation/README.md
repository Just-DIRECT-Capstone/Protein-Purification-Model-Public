This folder contains all of the important documentation we stored in our google drive throughout this project including:

1. Our initial meeting notes where we discussed how we would maintain the group and started with use cases
2. Meeting Notes from every weekly meeting and meeting with our sponsor
3. An excel key used to track the input parameters for each generated file type
4. Final presentation materials, written pitch, and summary for flyer

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about any of this information or group member contributions.
